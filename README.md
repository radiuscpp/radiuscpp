## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on **security-driven architecture**, **authentication systems**, and **low-level problem solving**.

I’ve worked in **cybersecurity**, built **server-authoritative authentication & licensing platforms**, and spent significant time **reverse engineering software** to understand how systems behave under real-world pressure.

My work prioritizes:
- server-side trust over client assumptions  
- realistic threat models  
- correctness, observability, and long-term maintainability

## 🔐 Areas of Focus

- Authentication & licensing systems  
- Application security & abuse prevention  
- Reverse engineering & binary analysis  
- Windows internals & tooling  
- Secure backend systems & APIs  
- Defensive design against real attackers

## ⭐ Featured Projects

### 🔹 SimpleConfig
Lightweight **C++20 configuration library** focused on clarity and performance.

### 🔹 ImGuiBase
Modern **Dear ImGui base** in DLL form — experimental, educational, and intentionally low-level.

> Most projects here focus on **foundational tooling**, **security concepts**, or **learning how systems fail** so they can be built better.

## 🧩 Philosophy

> **“Security isn’t about making something unbreakable —  
> it’s about making attacks expensive, detectable, and unsustainable.”**

I prefer **server-authoritative systems**, **behavioral analysis**, and **measured enforcement** over security theater.
